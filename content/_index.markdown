## Objectives
1. Explore the principles and global legal status of digital signatures.
2. Review current digital signature software.

## Abstract
With the recent changes in the legal status of digital signatures, in many parts of the world, we should be capable of using digital signatures as an alternative to handwritten signatures. That may be needed more than ever with digital being the preferred way of communication. This bachelor thesis aims to explore the principles and legal status of digital signatures, review current digital signature software, and explore possible obstacles open-source community is facing to develop such specialized applications. It proposes an open-source, cross-platform, and user-friendly software compliant with the eIDAS Regulation (Regulation No 910/2014). The before-mentioned application should enable average users to quickly sign and verify signatures of different types of documents and therefore easily use them in everyday life.
