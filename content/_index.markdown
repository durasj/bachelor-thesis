# Bachelor's thesis "Replacing handwritten signatures with open electronic signature software"
**Author:** Jakub Ďuraš

**Tutor:** RNDr. Viliam Kačala

**Keywords:** electronic signature, electronic seal, qualified, open-source, XAdES, PAdES, CAdES, desktop software

## Objectives
1. Explore the principles and global legal status of electronic signatures.
2. Review existing software and propose and develop open-source, cross-platform, and user-friendly platform for electronic document signing.
3. Provide information and way to create signatures compliant with eIDAS Regulation (Regulation No 910⁄2014).

## Abstract
With the recent changes in the legal status of electronic signatures in the world, there is an opportunity to expand the use of
electronic signatures as an alternative to handwritten signatures
outside the usual areas. Electronic signatures are becoming increasingly important in the age of electronic communication when
handwritten signatures are unpractical due to the need to print,
personally exchange, or send signed documents. We devote our
attention to the exploration of legal preconditions relevant for the
EU, technological preconditions, review of the existing software,
and proposal of our own software platform. The result is open,
user-friendly software for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Using
the application, it is possible, following the eIDAS Regulation, to
sign and verify the signature of any document with the legal effect of an attested signature. Our solution supports ID cards of
the Slovak Republic with the eID chip without any modifications or
settings, which enables easy use outside the usual use in web applications of the state. The application is not tied only to the Slovak
eID but is ready for further use with various devices in different
countries and as a platform for other types of signatures. Another
part is a website that, in addition to the possibility of downloading software and brief documentation, provides general information
about electronic signatures so that the project is as accessible to
the public as possible. We concentrate on simple extensibility of
the program via language translations, documentation, functionality, and general information.
