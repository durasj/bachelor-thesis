## Objectives
1. Explore the principles and global legal status of electronic signatures.

## Abstract
With the recent changes in the legal status of electronic signatures in many parts of the world, there is a need for easily accessible solutions intended as an alternative to handwritten signatures. This may be more necessary than ever since electronic communication is the preferred way of communication. This bachelor thesis aims to explore the principles and legal status of electronic signatures, review current electronic signature software, and explore possible obstacles the open-source community is facing to develop such specialized applications. We propose an open-source, cross-platform, and user-friendly software compliant with the eIDAS Regulation (Regulation No 910/2014). Our application should allow ordinary users to quickly sign and verify signatures of different types of documents and therefore easily use them in everyday life.
